// Create a method called getDurationString with two parameters, first parameter is minutes
// and 2nd parameter is seconds
// you should validate that the first parameter minutes is >= 0.
// You should validate that the 2nd parameter seconds is >= 0 and <= 59.
// Return "Invalid value" in the method if either of the above is not true
// If the parameters are valid then calculate how many hours minutes and seconds
// comprise the minutes and seconds passed to this method and return that value
// as string in format "xxh xxm xxs" where xx represents a number of hours minutes and seconds

// Create a 2nd method of the same name but with only one parameter seconds
// validate that it is >= 0, and return "Invalid value" if it is not true
// If it is valid, then calculate how many minutes are in the seconds and then
// call the other overloaded method passing the correct minutes and seconds calculated so
// that it can calculate correctly
// call both methods to print values in main method

// Tips
// Use int or long for your number data types is probably a good idea
// 1 minute == 60 seconds and 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds
// Methods should be static currently we are only using static methods

// Bonus:
// For the input 61 minutes output should be 01h 01m 00s, but it is ok if it is 1h 1m 0s(tip: use if-else)
// Create new project with name secondsAndMinutesChallenge
